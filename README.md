# FiMDP Evaluations

This repository hosts notebooks with evaluations to compare different solvers provided with in [FiMDP](https://github.com/FiMDP/FiMDP) and 
also to compare FiMDP with other popular open-source tools such as [Storm](https://www.stormchecker.org/). Some of these evaluations use
environments from [FiMDPEnv](https://github.com/FiMDP/FiMDPEnv).
